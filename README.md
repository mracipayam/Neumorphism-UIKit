# Neumorphism-UIKit

## Description
Tip #356: Neumorphism UIKit. Neumorphism is a new UI design trend that looks minimal and atheistically pleasing. The UI elements are the same color as the background but with light and dark shadows which creates this ‘3D’ effect.
The colors that are an exception to this design trend are pure white and black.
